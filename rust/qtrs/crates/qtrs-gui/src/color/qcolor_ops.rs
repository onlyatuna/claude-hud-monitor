//! `QColor::darker` / `QColor::lighter`.
//!
//! `[QT-SRC qcolor.cpp:2941-2997]` (`lighter`, `darker`), `:2363-2402` (`toHsv`) and `:2215-2290`
//! (`toRgb` from HSV). Qt keeps every component as 16 bits, changes only the HSV value (and, when it
//! overflows in `lighter`, the saturation) with integer arithmetic, and hands out 8-bit components
//! with `qt_div_257` (`QColor::red()`, `qdrawhelper_p.h:886-887`). All of that is reproduced here so
//! the 8-bit result matches Qt bit for bit; the result is therefore always an 8-bit colour.
